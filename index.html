    <p id="intro">Nate Silver remembers hearing the same caution many times when he attended the University of Chicago. Despite the university
      counting its diverse urban setting as one of its assets, students were warned not to go outside of the boundaries of their campus neighborhood. Segregation remains a problem in Chicago today.</p>
    
     <p id = "chicagoMsa">What is the difference between diversity and integration? To say that chicago is diverse, we are essentially looking at a map like this where we see that chicago has a great number of minority groups within its boundaries
   chicago by Msa</p>
    <p id = "chicagoTract">However if we look at the diversity within each of Chicago's neightborhoods, we see that neighborhoods are highly segregated by race.</p>
    
    <p id = "cityPlot">If we plot the two measures MSA-wide diversity and average tract diversity, we can see that the upper right quadrant </p>
