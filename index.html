    <p id="intro">Nate Silver remembers hearing the same caution many times when he attended the University of Chicago. Despite the university
      counting its diverse urban setting as one of its assets, students were warned not to go outside of the boundaries of their campus neighborhood. Segregation remains a problem in Chicago today.</p>
    
     <p id = "chicagoMsa">What is the difference between diversity and integration? To say that chicago is diverse, we are essentially looking at a map like this where we see that chicago has a great number of minority groups within its boundaries
   chicago by Msa</p>
    <p id = "chicagoTract">However if we look at the diversity within each of Chicago's neightborhoods, we see that neighborhoods are highly segregated by race.</p>
    
    <p id = "cityPlot">If we plot the two measures MSA-wide diversity and average tract diversity, we can see how cities compare. The lower left quadrant are cities that have neither diversity nor integration. </p>
    <div id = "plot"></div>

    <p id = "cityRank">Here are how the largest cities rank by this measure. Click any city to see how they look compared to their scores.</p>

    <p id = "miamiTract">Of the 10 largest msas by population, Miami comes in second, </p>
    <p id = "nycTract">along with the New York and New Jersey area.</p>
